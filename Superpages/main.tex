\section{Introduction}
Moder stock processors usually support somewhat large memory pages called superpages. Although very useful, it does create some challenges for the operating system in order to manage them efficiently; this article looks into solving this issue \cite{navarro2002practical}.
\section{Analysis}
TLB coverage could not keep up with memory accelerating size increases. This led to critical bottlenecks being imposed by TLB misses; addressing this problem, those before mentioned superpages were able to mitigate the problem bringing performance boots up to 30\% \cite{kandiraju2002characterizing}.

As a drawback, it does increase applications footprint and higher paging traffic, not to mention harder to solver fragmentation issues.

The proposed solution orbits around the idea of the occurrence of a page fault; it triggers the policy of finding the biggest aligned page observing that it includes the faulting page, do not overlap other pages and respects the end of the object.

Benchmarks focused on paging intensive activity and included: SP, FFTW, POvRay ray tracer, CINT2000 for integers, CFP2000 for floating-point crunching, Matrix a 1000x1000 matrix transposer, among others.

\section{Conclusion}
Observed results not only with frequently delivered performance benefits of 30-60\% as proved itself quite resilient to some ill-fated cases. The article highlights sustained benefits under heavy workloads and minimal overhead.
