\section{Introduction}

The Google File System is an article written in 2003 by Sanjay Ghemawat, Howard Gobioff, and Shun-Tak Leung \cite{ghemawat2003google}. The three of them were Google's employees back in the time.

By the time of publication, google was a five years old company with around 800 permanent employees \cite{google_coorp_info} and annual revenue of around 1 billion dollars. 2003 was the year prior to the company's IPO\cite{katje_2020}. Therefore, it was in their best interest to promote how this company was growth capable without significant scale frictions. This article proposes a distributed file system designed to serve the company internally.
